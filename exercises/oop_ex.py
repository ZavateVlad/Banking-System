"""
Design a simple banking system that demonstrates object-oriented principles.
The system should allow for creating multiple types of
bank accounts (e.g., checking and savings) with different behaviors,
 while ensuring that the core functionality (e.g., depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance)
 is shared across account types.
